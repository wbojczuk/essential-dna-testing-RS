        question: "Who pays for DNA testing?",
        answer: `Who pays for DNA testing depends on how it's done:

Family Support Division: If the Family Support Division (FSD) pays for the testing, the alleged father may be required to pay back the cost if he's found to be the father.

Court: If the court orders the testing, it will decide who pays for it.

Voluntary: If the mother and alleged father agree to pay for the testing themselves, they'll need to decide how to split the cost.`
